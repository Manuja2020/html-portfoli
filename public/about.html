   learned more about the things that as I've never imagine, i should tell  you it'was kinda great opportunity to
    experience, Also I've learned UI/UX designing to give customers a better product.</p>

   it was totally worth it, to have such a knowlege.Also these fields are related in a compicated way which
  is for an example with cyber security i can learn how to secure a website from scratch with that i can offer 
  security process for my customers</p>
